## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Michael!
I'm an SDSU computer science student and I enjoy working in Java SpringBoot and Swift. I'm currently dabbling with Identity Providers, JWT, Java JPA and AWS. I love using GitHub project boards and issue templates to track development. I am leveraging these technologies for my current project in development, Parchment Recipes, which is a great way to scan, save, organize, and search for recipes.

## ðŸ’» Languages, Technologies and Frameworks
Java, SpringBoot, Swift, MySQL, scrum methodology

## ðŸ“œ Certifications
* [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (July 2024)](https://www.credly.com/badges/9fc5f947-b622-406c-9f00-afb2f9f8dd1d/public_url)

Topics that I want to explore further: CloudFront edge locations, Identity Provider (IdP) types, and containerization for space optimization on VMs.

My takeaways for deploying my own projects:
1. Use autoscaling groups and an application load balancer to manage traffic creating a highly available server on EC2.
2. Deploy multi-availability zone RDS instances for high durability in the event of disaster recovery.
